### TheSTEAMtruck.ca
Its official â€“ the STEAM truck is now on the road.

After several years of operation as the **MakerMobile** based out of Vancouver BC the same truck is now operating from a base in the West Kootenays.
Thanks and acknowledgement is due to the early tutors, instructors and operators who spent days and hours in developing what we believe was the first Canadian Mobile Makerspace.

### Whats in a name?
The STEAM truck as it will now be known is available for any educational hands-on activity with a focus on Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics.
By changing our name we are now also uniquely identified 

Yes the truck also facilitates Up-cycling, Fix-it and above all FUN events where we challenge participants to come up with wrong and out-of-the-box ideas.
If you are interested in having the truck and its facilities at your disposal be sure to contact us by email to : [theSTEAMtruck@gmail.com](mailto:theSTEAMtruck@gmail.com)

We also have plans to simply deliver and return the vehicle to your location for you as a teacher, tutor or instructor to run a program. 
(Training accreditation may be required)
