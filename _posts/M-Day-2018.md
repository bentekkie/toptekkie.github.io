#### theSTEAMtruck will be SALMO Valley Farmers Market Mothers' Day event

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/M-Day-Salmo.png)
Lets all 'spring up' at the KP Park to make things for mom's.
The project planned is to convert a well used t-shirt into a useful re-usable shopping tote bag.
We have many tools too so if mom has something to be fixed/repaired 
or upcycled we would be glad to attend to that too.
