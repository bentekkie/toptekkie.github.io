#### The new age of the local Libraries - E-kits to Go!

Salmo Public Library not only has the books but now you can take home Electronic kits
to learn all about Arduino microcontrollers and the coding required to make things that work.

In the next few months watch for workshops and hands-on courses at the Library and in theSTEAMtruck on the 
projects that can be built up using these kits.
