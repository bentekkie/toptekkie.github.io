#### A fun day using the tools at VHS to build a SeaPerch ROV

The Seaperch is a cool tethered underwater robot used in over 30 pool locations in the USA

This basic submersible has become a standard ROV in the USA and forms
part of national and regional competitions attracting thousands of participating 
individuals and groups.
The robot is used byt an team to carry out a timed specific search and rescue mission
during which points are earned for challenges presented to the ROV.
Some of these are as follows:
Enter a cave - proceed through an underwater suspended loop
Navigate to a beacon under the water on the floor of the pool
Retrieve a target from the cave regional
Return with the recovered object through the cave entrance.

Plans are in preparation to introduce these to the Salmo and local area pools
to develop a regional tournament towards the Summer of 2019.
