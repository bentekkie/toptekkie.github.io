#### theSTEAMtruck carried on the construction of Structures

We explored the strength of the triangle and with the use of plastic straw connectors 
developed by the folks from MakerMobile - Sierpinski pyramids were constructed. 

Despite the desire to destroy the built pyramids- always lots of fun!! - the decision was to save them for a future add-on session.
