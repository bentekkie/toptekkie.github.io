#### The Poetry Phone now operating at the SVYCC in Salmo.

After a recent visit to Vancouver with theSTEAMtruck we returned with the much loved Poetry Phone.

Come by the SVYCC to listen to some excellent words of wisdom.
These audio clips of poets and contributors are to be updated regularly.
If you have a poem or verse that you would like to add then record the
audio - max length 2 minutes - and mail to thesteamtruck at gmail.com
Please indicate the name of the originator and composer of any music recorded.
