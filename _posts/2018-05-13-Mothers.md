#### theSTEAMtruck saves the planert from plastic shopping bags

To celebrate Mothers' Day we got down to work in Salmo's KP Park to convert old T-Shirts into useable shhopping bags/totes.
Kids and edults alike tooled up with fabric scissors and the 'STEAM' Brother sewing machine to make the conversions.

One of the conversions here.
Process used prefered the sewed seam rather than the optional tied bottom of the bag.
