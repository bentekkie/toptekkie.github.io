#### Did you get a chance to activate the Train in the window at the Salmo and District Chamber of Commerce 

Remembering the hand operated train years ago in the window in Kerrisdale 
I recreated the feature and its now in operation for the festive 
season here in Salmo

The control is now at the model train exhibit at Waneta Mall - June 2019
