#### WHATS THIS GOT TO DO WITH COUCH SURFING?

In 1968 ... sooner than I knew it ... I was told-off on the air, by a very friendly Radio Ham to stop using the frequency to illicitly retransmit radio broadcasts and quickly introduced to the world of Ham Radio. This remarkable hobby and past-time was surely the very first technological instant social networking platform. (Pen-pals and post cards perhaps beating them by a few decades)

Here radio transmitting operators could instantly communicate with others at the speed of light - but tamed down with CW (morse code) to a manageable 12 words per minute or thereabouts.  (Presumably only humans were listening as no alien has yet joined in a QSO - conversation to the uninitiated)

All over the world these radio hams including myself (under the guise of ZR6AK and ZS6RW) closeted themselves in their ‘shacks’ almost married to their ‘rigs’ and could chat for countless hours to people they had never met, most likely would never meet or had conjured up pictures of the person - which in many cases were great disappointments when the ever me in real life.

Fast forward to today with me now known in this community as VA7FSE and now also linked by the likes of Facebook, Twitter, Skype and whatever else is out there.

But only of late have I discovered the world of face-to-face-book in the form of Couch Surfing. Here a open and transparent meeting place exists where one not only shares conversations, greetings and friendly chat, but you actually get to MEET your CS’ers for REAL.

No more hiding, ducking or pretending to be who or what you are but a true and honest sharing of ideas, thoughts and facilities with one another. Couch Surfing has become to me a great meeting, networking and rewarding activity by being able to share accommodation, local information and knowledge of world issues from people who all embrace the notion of one planet and one people.
