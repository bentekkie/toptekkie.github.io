#### RSVP No.1 - The CAN Challenge

theSTEAMtruck is launching this series of challenges to incentivize out-of-the-box
thinking for solutions to the problem in an effort to find practical, clever
and innovative ways as a Race to SaVe our Planet.
Challenge No. 1
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Rustycans.jpg)
Your task is to put on your thinking cap and suggest a process, alternative use or 
method that can avoid steel metal objects from cluttering up and rusting away in our landfills.
Aluminium can be recycled and so can (pun intended) steel even with tin plating and plastic 
lining for protecting foodstuff.
Sadly much ot this is not recycled - so what can you think of to resolve this.

Send in your ideas - feel free to research whats out there already - no matter how crazy you 
think they are and the judges will select a winner on the Thursday following the Friday launch 
of the challenge.

#### Entries in .pdf or .jpg/.png format can be emailed to thesteamtruck@gmail.com
