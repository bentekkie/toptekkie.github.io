#### The Tool Collection for theSTEAMbus continues to grow.

The week after the bus arrived a welcome delivery of a package to test for Canadian Tire was collected from the Purolator Depot in Trail.
WOW! A marvelous set of 200+ socket-set and wrenches in its own worktop drawer style toolbox.
A video and user feedback comment to follow soon.

Additional to this we have now received a useful donation of a full set of screw drivers and ring wrenches

Now located in the bus we also have the tools that were donated in 2017 including the following items:
 - an Oscilloscope
 - radial arm saw - (assortment of blades required)
 - chop saw
 - pottery wheel (motor speed control pedal under development)
 - vacuum cleaner
 - filter coffee machine
 - weller soldering station
 - Singer sewing machine
 - 100W soldering/cutting gun
 + several small items
