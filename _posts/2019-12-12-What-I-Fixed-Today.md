#### What I Fixed Today (WIFT#1)

The start of something new.
Becoming known as the Mr Fixit - seldon a day goes by without having to rack my 
brain and innovate a new solution to put something ack into operation.

In this inaugural post we have a cool zoomable LED flashlight.

When received it arrived with a loose switch assembly, a spring and besides the 
flashlight body and battery holder not much else.

Bsiclly it did not work!

First - manufactured a small 4mm dia x 5mm aluminium tube inside the spring loaded
switch activtor.
Determined a 4mm spacer was missing between the switch assembly and the battery holder.
Added a Lexan retaining ring to secure the switch assembly inside the threaded housing.
Arranged a support for the central battery / switch contact.

Hey presto! One amazing working flashligh - if only this was mine ;)
