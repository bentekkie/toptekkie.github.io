#### It may be a small addition but it looks great!

Besides the magnifying headset and great spot-lighting in the truck this was a great addition to our toolset to recently have acquired a USB connected 1000x microscope.

Now crystal clear images can be viewed of the smallest components and further enhancing the ability to ensure quality work as with soldering etc.

The application software is loaded on all the laptops in the truck.

Images can further be saved for use in documentation or fo other purposes.
