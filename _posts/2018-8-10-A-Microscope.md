#### It may be a small addition but it looks great!

Besides the magnifying headset and great spot-lighting in the truck this USB connected 1000x microscope is a great addition to our toolset.

Now crystal clear images can be viewed of the smallest components and further enhancing the ability to ensure quality work as with soldering etc.

The application software is loaded on all the laptops in the truck.

Images can further be saved for use in documentation or for other purposes.
