title:  How NOT to fix a chopsaw switch.

#### Another great repair job.

As part of theSTEAMtruck activities recently we were called upon to fix a well used chopsaw with a reported iffy power switch.

Well! What a discovery after opening the housing to find apiece of wood jamnmed in by a prior "hacker" to fix the broken switch lever supports.

The idea was good but the remedy was anything but good. As can be seen in the picture the wood shim eventually cracked and provided no support at all.

The real fix was to mill out the old broken support and add a new screw and solid plastic insert to ensure a rigid, solid structure.

Sad that good money was spent on such a hack job by persons unknown in the past.
