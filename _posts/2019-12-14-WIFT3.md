#### WIFT3

Handy Bag Holder 

Recently I was shown a handy device to hook shopping bags onto.

This makes life much easier than having to have small straps bite 
into ones fingers especially if the bags are loaded and heavy.

The device I was shown consisted of two round lathe turned wooden 
discs (wheels) screwed to the ends of a short piece of wooden dowel.

To produce these here "in the bush" I decided to 3D print the two ends and 
fashion a short section of wooden branch suitably sized and cut to length.
