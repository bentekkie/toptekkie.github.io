#### THE JOKER’S IN THE HOUSE - BENJAMIN’S SCHOOL TURNS 100

As the Co-Chair with Sophie Petric of the School PAC - we tackled this momentous event and successfully managed to cater for a wonderful crowd of nearly 1000 people - after months of planning, co-ordination and meeting after meeting.

The event show-cased the achievements in the music and arts departments over the past years as well as included acts by the current students of some breathtaking dance routines.

Video footage of the events as well as the documentary of the school prepared by Rob Howatson - JO by the Numbers is available for viewing on the anniversary website - www.jo100.ca

Of course yours truly volunteered to wear the traditional Joker (jester) costume made for the documentary as seen below with the Mayor for Vancouver by the modo Nissan Leaf on display with the 100 year old Detroit.
