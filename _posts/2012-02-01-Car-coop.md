#### CAR SHARING - OR HOW TO FIT MORE CARS ON THE ROAD?

Wow - what a job for a ‘McGyver’ like me.

Day after day solving the problems of some 200++ cars in the city.

Today its punctures - a good sign of the booming home building industry.

Lots of screws and nails lying around!


Then its flat batteries due to drivers leaving keys in ignition and or lights on.


Of course the occasional light bulbs and damage incidents regularly occur too.

One gets quite attached to the vehicles and strangely enough I get to feel quite sentimental after seeing some of the older hard-working vehicles being retired after a good life on the road.
